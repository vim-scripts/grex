*grex* is a Vim plugin to provide useful commands to operate on lines matched
to the last search pattern.  For example, suppose you edit the following
content:

	#950 bugfix: jump behavior
	#923 bugfix: vs fold
	#930 enhancement: foldlevel adjustment
	#927 todo: release
	#926 enhancement: performance
	#924 enhancement: completion
	#931 bugfix: syntax highlighting
	#928 enhancement: key mappings

Once you search for a keyword such as "bugfix:", you can yank all lines
matched to the search pattern with |:Grey|.  After executing |:Grey|, you can
put the following text:

	#950 bugfix: jump behavior
	#923 bugfix: vs fold
	#931 bugfix: syntax highlighting

There is another command |:Gred| which deletes matched lines instead.

This plugin also provides functions and operators to do the same processes as
|:Gred| or |:Grey|.  See |grex-functions|, |grex-key-mappings| and
|grex-commands| for the details.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later

Optionals:
- |operator-user| 0.0.5 or later (vimscript#2692)
